Hello everyone vaishnavi here
so here i have built an website using react for the frontend part and used redux for managing my state...
so after you clone you can just type npm install and next install all the packages needed to view the application. 
also if you just wanted to see the working of the website you can directly see the working illustration by clicking on the link attached here https://youtu.be/saTPz73CjUI?si=Jd0LPFMulF5lDjhe
